### **1\. GuardDuty — Threat Detection**

*   **GuardDuty** is AWS’ managed threat-detection service.
    
*   Continuously monitors your AWS accounts, workloads, and logs for suspicious or malicious activity.
    
*   _“Hey, this looks bad.”_
    

### **2\. EventBridge — Event Routing**

*   GuardDuty automatically sends its findings to **Amazon EventBridge**.
    
*   EventBridge acts as an **event router**, matching incoming findings to rules you define.
    
*   A rule forwards each finding to a **Lambda function** for further processing.
    

### **3\. Lambda — Trigger the Workflow**

*   A small **Lambda function** receives the finding from EventBridge.
    
*   Its job is to **start a Step Functions workflow**, passing the GuardDuty data along.
    

### **4\. Step Functions — Orchestration Layer**

*   **AWS Step Functions** coordinates the multi-step process.
    
*   Inside the workflow, another Lambda function is invoked to handle the AI summarisation workflow.
    

### **5\. Lambda → Amazon Bedrock — AI Summarisation**

*   The second **Lambda function** calls **Amazon Bedrock**.
    
*   *   What the threat is
        
    *   Why it matters
        
    *   Potential impact
        
    *   (Optional) Suggested remediation steps
        

### **6\. Amazon SNS — Notification Delivery**

*   The AI-generated summary is then published to **Amazon SNS**.
    
*   SNS sends an **email notification** containing the **AI-written threat summary**.
    

**Final Outcome**
-----------------

You receive an automated **email with a clear, human-readable explanation** of a GuardDuty finding — fully generated by AI, triggered by real-time threat detection.
